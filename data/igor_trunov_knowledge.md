## Entrepreneurial and Leadership Philosophy

### People‑First Management

Igor insists on a "people first" philosophy. He believes the business is built thanks to employees' efforts, so most processes focus on developing and supporting employees. The company conducts regular performance reviews to discuss strengths, weaknesses and goals; feedback helps prevent resignations. When someone decides to leave, they treat it individually and try to retain them.

He contrasts American management (extract value and replace) with a Japanese‑like model where employees are nurtured for the long term. His company opts for continuous improvement: rather than replacing underperformers, leaders identify what can be done together to enhance the employee's effectiveness.

For relocation (e.g., opening a Serbian office), they provided compensation packages for housing, relocation and support. He admits mistakes such as not clarifying whether the move was temporary or permanent and not ensuring comfortable workspaces; the lesson is to plan every detail and align expectations.

When the company grew from ~100 to ~250 people, about half of the original staff stayed; he stresses that employees should outpace the company's growth, so training and development are constant. Attrition is normal when expectations rise.

### Leadership and Management Advice

**Balancing technical and managerial skills**: A leader must balance hard and soft skills: leadership, communication, strategic foresight, time management, delegation and trust. Igor recounts promoting a top programmer to a leadership role and realizing technical expertise alone isn't enough. Leaders should continuously learn, stay informed about industry trends and build trust in teams.

**Strategic sessions**: In a fast-moving startup, regular strategic sessions help teams step back from daily tasks, evaluate progress and align cross-functional teams. Using a professional facilitator keeps sessions focused, and openness and curiosity shape culture.

**Non-operational management**: Entrepreneurs should eventually delegate day-to-day operations to focus on strategic development. Igor lists conditions for this step (stable operations, skilled staff, established processes, financial independence) and warns against delegating authority without responsibility or interfering after delegation.

**Time management**: Novice executives should avoid overloading themselves; delegate routine and specialized tasks, customize time-management systems to their rhythms, and prioritize rest to avoid burnout.

**Personnel training**: Corporate education upgrades skills, motivates teams and saves hiring costs. Igor advocates both external (seminars, courses, online programs) and internal training (meetings with company leaders, internal seminars). Steps include creating job descriptions, diagnosing motivation, assessing needs, budgeting, developing evaluation procedures and adjusting based on feedback.

## Tips for Startups and Product Development

### Common mistakes in IT project development
Not researching the market, relying solely on customer development (CustDev), lacking expertise, underestimating monetization and neglecting diversification/scalability are critical mistakes. Igor's early projects faced registration and error issues across countries; using agile methodology and structured use cases helped fix problems. He emphasizes trust and respect for employees.

### Saving on mobile app development
To reduce costs, start with a minimal viable product (MVP), use no-code tools to test hypotheses, adopt a monolithic approach initially, build cross-platform apps, hire developers from lower-cost regions, offer equity and compare service costs.

### Seven steps to create innovative products
1. Build a team with founder, product manager, full-stack developer and designer
2. Conduct market research
3. Find an innovative idea by solving problems or creating new markets
4. Collect feedback
5. Create a prototype and iterate
6. Prepare a marketing/commercialization plan
7. Launch and scale based on reactions

### Workload and burnout
Plan your day, accept that some expectations will not be met, set achievable goals, take care of yourself, delegate and critically ask whether everything you do is necessary.

### Hiring trends
The IT talent market is growing; education requirements are decreasing, internships are used to recruit young talent and wages are rising. Recruiters should use analytics and automation, deploy chatbots for applicant selection, create referral programs and internships, and screen for soft skills and culture fit.

## View on Artificial Intelligence and Technology Trends

### Adoption of AI
Igor writes about using AI to automate tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, data analysis, automation of accounting, fraud detection, healthcare, logistics and game development. His company delegates routine tasks to AI so employees can focus on high-value work. He foresees specialized AI models emerging and advises businesses to identify tasks where AI is effective, train staff to use AI, verify results, protect privacy, encourage feedback and align AI use with company goals.

### Generative AI predictions
In a LinkedIn post, he predicts that within a year generative AI will generate entire products and apps from descriptions, democratizing startup creation and boosting productivity. He expects that by 2027, 15% of new applications could be generated automatically.

## Hiring Philosophy and Team Building

In a LinkedIn post, Igor argues that hiring problems arise when founders do not know whom they need. Hiring should be based on identity and qualities (such as intelligence and flexibility) rather than resumes. You need people who can sail with you in a startup "storm".

Another LinkedIn post states that success is not a sprint; business should be run at a sustainable pace. Igor advocates getting enough sleep, delegating tasks and focusing on a few strong ideas rather than overworking.

He encourages entrepreneurs to set big goals; he suggests studying biographies of successful people (e.g., Walt Disney, Steve Jobs), watching inspiring movies such as The Social Network, visualizing the ideal future and creating step-by-step plans.

He recommends TV series for entrepreneurs: Silicon Valley, Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber, WeCrashed and The Morning Show; these shows teach about startups, leadership, legal battles and team dynamics.

In the TechBullion article, Igor advises replacing status meetings with written narrative updates. Each team member writes weekly about what they learned, obstacles encountered and changes in thinking; this saves time, promotes structured thought and fosters autonomy. He suggests trying a week without meetings to reveal alignment issues and stresses that trusting employees speeds execution.

## Performance Marketing and Company Evolution

Igor co‑founded a performance‑marketing company (Alfaleads) around eight years before his 2023–25 interviews. The agency was launched from zero without external investment, and he and his partners used their own savings to get started. Through careful planning, a strong team and continuous experimentation, the business achieved approximately 300% annual growth during its early years and expanded into multiple internal startups. It eventually became a holding with offices in several countries and a head office in Belgrade. By 2024 it employed roughly 300–400 people and regularly won industry awards. Igor later stepped away from day‑to‑day operations and now sits on the board of directors, focusing on strategic decisions. Exiting operations required months of preparation: delegating authority to a new management team, establishing clear processes and mentally letting go of control. He notes that leaving operations is as much a mental challenge as a technical one.

**Learnings from the performance‑marketing business:**
• **Bootstrapping builds resilience**. Starting from scratch forces entrepreneurs to focus on fundamentals like product–market fit and cash flow.
• **Continuous learning at each stage**. As the company grew, Igor had to educate himself in management, finance and international expansion. Each growth phase demanded new skills and perspectives.
• **Delegation and user experience**. He stresses that everything that can be delegated should be delegated. Hiring a strong designer and focusing on user experience were critical early decisions; a good user interface helps transform technical products into accessible solutions.
• **Talent pipeline**. The company became a talent factory: many employees moved on to higher positions in other companies, demonstrating that the training programs worked and reinforcing the people‑first philosophy.
• **Life after operations**. After leaving operations, Igor devoted more time to new ventures, mentoring entrepreneurs and considering how to make a broader impact on society.

**Entering the world of science‑driven startups:**
Once free from operational duties, Igor sought a project aligned with his love of science and science fiction. He partnered with Roman (a long‑time collaborator) and launched Atlantix/ATX, a platform dedicated to bringing university innovations to market. The idea originated with Igor, and the partners built upon earlier concepts (such as a news‑aggregator for tech professionals) they had explored together. Atlantix aims to collect tens of thousands of innovations from universities worldwide, describe them in plain language, evaluate their market potential and provide entrepreneurs with roadmaps and customized business plans. The system uses artificial intelligence and expert analysis to match technologies to specific locations and market conditions. Atlantix also connects users to over one hundred accelerators, venture funds and educational resources. Its mission is to reduce the lag between scientific discovery and commercialization by 50% within five years and to become a global hub for technology transfer with no direct competitors.

**Key features of Atlantix described in Igor's interview:**
• **Innovation catalog**. The platform aggregates tens of thousands of university innovations (initially around 10,000) across robotics, energy, climate change, medtech, biotech, foodtech and AI. Each innovation is explained in simple language, accompanied by visual prototypes and detailed business cases (expected output, market size, roadmap). Algorithms convert complex technical documents into understandable descriptions and generate prototypes so entrepreneurs can quickly grasp the idea.
• **Customized business plans**. Roadmaps are tailored to the user's location, taking into account local market conditions, workforce specifics and regulations. Entrepreneurs can explore how to build real businesses from novel technologies rather than yet another chatbot.
• **Ecosystem connections**. Atlantix offers direct access to more than one hundred accelerators worldwide, venture funds and other financial institutions. Its Smart Search feature recommends innovations based on the entrepreneur's experience, skills, funding capacity and goals.
• **Pricing**. The base subscription for entrepreneurs is about $2,000. Pricing may evolve as the platform adds more value.
• **People‑first workspace**. After leaving operations, Igor and his partners created a co‑working office in Belgrade where small startups can work comfortably. The space includes open areas, private rooms, sound‑isolated meeting rooms and recreational zones. It embodies their belief that people remain at the centre of innovation, even in an AI‑driven world.
• **Mission and vision**. Igor wants Atlantix to accelerate technology transfer so that more "unicorn" startups emerge. He believes that society will see many more unicorns in the next five years as technologies reach the market faster; money is a by‑product of turning technology into products—the real goal is to improve lives and ensure future generations enjoy a better world.
• **Research‑driven development**. Igor emphasises that ideas must be grounded in research. Entrepreneurs should start by studying the market and talking to people working "on the ground" in laboratories and industries—not just executives. They used customer‑development interviews and market analysis to understand how innovations (e.g., Apple, Uber) emerged. Prototypes were iterated based on feedback. User experience design is vital for turning abstruse technical documents into accessible product concepts. Delegation, lean teams and continuous iteration are core principles; everything that can be delegated is delegated so the core team can move quickly.
• **Inspirations**. Igor keeps a photo of Steve Jobs in his home as motivation, admiring Jobs as a pioneer and salesperson. He points out that behind every visionary there is a less visible innovator like Steve Wozniak, whose engineering brilliance set the direction for the computer industry. He believes the true age of innovation will begin when every entrepreneur has their own "Wozniak."
• **Personal motto**. Igor often says he never gives up; he always goes "to the last." He encourages entrepreneurs to stay confident, embrace mistakes and keep moving forward.
